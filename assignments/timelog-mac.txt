Timelog for 3/29/2019
--------------------------------

3/13/2019 6:00PM - 9:00PM - Testing basic tasks w/ SDL2
    - Read through first chapter of SDL Game Development by Shaun Mitchell
    - Made a quick SDL test that loads a blank window

3/24/2019 10:00PM - 12:00PM - Cleaning up before groupmates look at my spaghetti code and rendering images
    - Commented/used some better looking code for the blank window test so that it was useful for groupmates
    - Read more into aforementioned ebook
    - Quickly threw together another SDL program that renders a dumb BMP image

3/25/2019 9:00AM - 11:00AM - Working with milestones and OOP
    - Made milestones for this week
    - Made a header interface for an object oriented game

3/28/2019 11:20AM - 12:00AM - Incremental changes
    - Continued work on the header
    - Tried and failed at making a good make file multiple times

3/29/2019 12:40PM-3:40PM - Finishing challenge
    - Resorted to making an explicit make file that still isn't good
    - Fixed the style sheet rendering in ssTest so that it will render different frames
        - The problem is that the frames don't seem to have super consistent size, etc
        - Maybe look into converting gifs to frames or something
    - Made the game object test work to a good extent
        - Used what I consider good OOP principles
